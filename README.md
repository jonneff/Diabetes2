A brief analysis of the UC Irvine Diabetes Dataset 1999-2008

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.

The dataset used here represents 10 years (1999 - 2008) of clinical care related to inpatient diabetes treatment at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It includes over 50 features representing patient and hospital outcomes. Information was extracted from the Health Facts database (Cerner Corporation, Kansas City, MO), a national data warehouse that collects comprehensive clinical records across hospitals throughout the United States.

My objective in analyzing this dataset is to see if I can duplicate results from the 2014 paper listed in the References section of the Ipython notebook. In particular, I will train a logistic regression model to predict whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge.
